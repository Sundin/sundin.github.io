# My Awesome Blog

This blog was created using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/).

## Running locally 
    bundle exec jekyll serve

The site is now running at `http://localhost:4000`. Refresh the page in your browser to see changes.

## Drafts

Drafts are posts without a date in the filename. They’re posts you’re still working on and don’t want to publish yet. To get up and running with drafts, create a _drafts folder in your site’s root and create your first draft.

To preview your site with drafts, simply run `jekyll serve` or `jekyll build` with the `--drafts` switch. Each will be assigned the value modification time of the draft file for its date, and thus you will see currently edited drafts as the latest posts.

## TODO

* Add script for generating an empty draft file.
* Add script for moving a draft into _posts and giving it a date.
