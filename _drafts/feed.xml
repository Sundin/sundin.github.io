Include images in both questions and answers. Provide personal context will help you with memorizing (like where your first learned it, examples from your life etc). Use screenshots if you don&amp;rsquo;t want to spend time formulas and code snippets. Avoid transparent backgrounds in case you switch between dark/light modes or different clients (Desktop/iOS/Android etc). Avoid having lists as answers. You can add more details and context in the answer part to refresh your memory on a topic.</description></item></channel></rss>
