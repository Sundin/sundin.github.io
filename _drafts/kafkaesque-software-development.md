Will a new feature add value or decrease it?
A common danger to many software engineering effort is feature creep. This is ....
Worse still, endless debating about the color of a button or the design of an algorithm can actually cripple the development process severly.

So will a new feature add value or decrease it? The (post-mortemly) famous writer Franz Kafka asked this question in his story The Burrow already in the 1920s, pre-dating the birth of software development by ....

The story is about an unidentified animal building a burrow for protection. 
.....

Just like the animal in the story, we will never reason the answer to our question out. But unlike the animal, we are able to experiment cheaply and without risk of getting killed.
In nature, experiments are also carried out by real animals all the time due to random mutations which change their behaviour (perhaps by constructiong their burrow in a slightly different way) in subtle ways. The only way for the animal to get feedback from the experiment though is to wait for the process of natural selection to either kill off the animal or enable it to successfully pass on its genes to its offspring. In nature, this process has been repeated over and over again across countless millenia. The result is ....
Individuals that built feature A was sorted out while those that built feature B prospered and multiplied. 

When it comes to software, people usually donâ€™t have to die or get hurt in order for us to learn from our mistakes. And we can saccelerate the process of learning by running controlled experiments with short feedback loops.

Here are some well-proven techniques for running controlled experiments to get you started (also, beware overfitting to early adapters - run your experiments continuously).
A/B testing
Rapid/paper prototyping
User analytics
Capturing user feedback
