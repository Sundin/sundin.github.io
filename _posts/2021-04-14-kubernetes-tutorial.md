Currently I'm learning [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/) and [Flux](https://fluxcd.io/). Two of my top three favourite methods for learning something is [to write about it](https://sundin.github.io/) and [to teach it to someone else](https://fs.blog/2012/04/feynman-technique/). This time I combined the two into a short tutorial on what I have learnt so far. If you are interested, [you will find my Kubernetes tutorial on Github](https://github.com/Sundin/kubernetes-tutorial)!
