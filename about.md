My name is Gustav Sundin and I currently work as software engineering consultant at [Devies](https://www.devies.se) in Gothenburg, Sweden. I also hold a Master's degree in Software Engineering from Chalmers University. A cool thing with that is that I am allowed to titulate myself "Master of Software Engineering"!

Apart from being obsessed by software engineering (software architecture being the area I'm most interested in), I'm also a heavy metal maniac. You will find my [metallic writing here](https://www.jawbreaker.se/blog).
