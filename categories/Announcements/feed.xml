Its purpose is to act as the entry point to your server. It will redirect incoming traffic to one out of many Docker-based applications running on the same server, based on the hostname in the incoming request.
The rationale behind this is that it enables you to host as many services as you want on the same server, while still only keeping ports 80 and 443 open to the outside world.</description></item><item><title>Welcome!</title><link>/welcome/</link><pubDate>Sat, 22 Sep 2018 17:27:45 +0000</pubDate><guid>/welcome/</guid><description>Welcome to my blog on software engineering!
In my daily work as a software engineer, I read and think a lot on various topics and also write a lot of notes as I do so. My main goal with this website is to gather some of my notes in a single place and in a slightly more readable format. By making everything public it feels like I force myself into cultivating my thoughts and ideas into a more concrete form.</description></item></channel></rss>
