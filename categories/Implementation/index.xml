Two of my top three favourite methods for learning something is to write about it and to teach it to someone else. This time I combined the two into a short tutorial on what I have learnt so far. If you are interested, you will find my Kubernetes tutorial on Github!</description></item><item><title>Minimize Java Lambda Cold Start Times</title><link>/post/2021-04-08-minimize-java-lambda-coldstarts/</link><pubDate>Thu, 08 Apr 2021 09:25:58 +0000</pubDate><guid>/post/2021-04-08-minimize-java-lambda-coldstarts/</guid><description>If you have ever run Java inside a lambda function on AWS, you will have noticed the quite significant cold start times that comes with spinning up the JVM environment. In this post, I will discuss some different tricks you can use to minimize these cold start times.
The problem with cold starts arises when there are no &amp;ldquo;warm&amp;rdquo; lambda available to handle an incoming request, which usally happens whenever an endpoint experiences a large and sudden spike in traffic.</description></item><item><title>Migrating data between DynamoDB tables</title><link>/post/2021-03-30-dynamodb-migrations/</link><pubDate>Tue, 30 Mar 2021 10:34:41 +0000</pubDate><guid>/post/2021-03-30-dynamodb-migrations/</guid><description>When setting up a new DynamoDB table, an important decision is to decide what primary key to use.

Such information will enable you to scale your backend properly, fine-tune the user experience and weed out unused features. Some even go so far as claiming that data is the &amp;ldquo;gold of our time&amp;rdquo;. Regardless of the truth of that claim, few can dispute the usefulness of user analytics data.
The go-to solution for most developers is to use Google Analytics (in fact used by 55% of all websites) or some other third party framework.</description></item></channel></rss>
