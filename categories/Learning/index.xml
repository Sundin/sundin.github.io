Two of my top three favourite methods for learning something is to write about it and to teach it to someone else. This time I combined the two into a short tutorial on what I have learnt so far. If you are interested, you will find my Kubernetes tutorial on Github!</description></item><item><title>How I Read a Book</title><link>/post/2020-10-14-how-to-read/</link><pubDate>Wed, 14 Oct 2020 11:28:50 +0000</pubDate><guid>/post/2020-10-14-how-to-read/</guid><description>I read at least 25 books per year, both fiction and non-fiction. I have also worked out a system in order to get as much out of each of these books as possible, and most importantly to actually remember what I read. Today I would like to share my system in case it might help someone else.
This is how I read a book.
