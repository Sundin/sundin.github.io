In this blog post I will show you how!
What we will build Here&amp;rsquo;s how my custom dialog looks like (screenshot taken from my RPG app Sound Realms: Mace &amp;amp; Magic). You can see that it differs quite a bit from the standard dialog.</description></item><item><title>How to use HTTPS on localhost</title><link>/localhost-https/</link><pubDate>Wed, 05 Jan 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/localhost-https/</guid><description>Sometimes you want to have your application running on HTTPS even when testing it out locally. One common approach is to use a self-signed certificate, but this method has some pitfalls - most notably that any browser will frown upon your certificate and start shouting that it is insecure. A more robust approach is to use a certificate generated by a Certificate Authority (CA). How? Enter mkcert, which lets you act as your own CA.</description></item><item><title>Setup Raspberry Pi to act as your own web server</title><link>/Setup-Raspberry-Pi-to-act-as-your-own-web-server/</link><pubDate>Fri, 17 Sep 2021 10:58:32 +0200</pubDate><guid>/Setup-Raspberry-Pi-to-act-as-your-own-web-server/</guid><description>In this blog post I will describe how I set up my own web server using just a single Raspberry Pi at home. This is a cheap and fun solution to hosting your own applications, in my case using Docker.
Setting up the Raspberry Pi Install the Raspbian OS on your Raspberry Pi&amp;rsquo;s SD card.
In order to connect wirelessly to the Raspberry without having it connect to a monitor, you need to set up headless SSH.</description></item><item><title>Runtime Environment Variables in the Browser</title><link>/runtime-env-vars/</link><pubDate>Wed, 30 Jun 2021 10:58:32 +0200</pubDate><guid>/runtime-env-vars/</guid><description>A limitation to all web development frameworks is that environment variables has to be injected during build time in order to made be available in the browser. If we have packaged our web application using Docker, that means that we would need to build a different container image for each different environment where we will want to host our application. This is a waste of resources and also introduces a risk of us ending up with a different codebase in our production environment than what we tried out in our QA or test environment.</description></item><item><title>How to Build a Reverse Proxy</title><link>/nginx-reverse-proxy/</link><pubDate>Mon, 28 Jun 2021 10:58:32 +0200</pubDate><guid>/nginx-reverse-proxy/</guid><description>In this blog post I will describe how you can deploy services on the same server. The server will be fronted by an NGINX instance acting as a reverse proxy responsible for forwarding incoming traffic to the right service.
I will use an EC2 instance on AWS since it has a low monthly cost and I don&amp;rsquo;t have to worry about hardware maintenance at all, but you can use the same approach for any kind of server.</description></item><item><title>A short Kubernetes tutorial</title><link>/kubernetes-tutorial/</link><pubDate>Wed, 14 Apr 2021 08:31:41 +0000</pubDate><guid>/kubernetes-tutorial/</guid><description>Currently I&amp;rsquo;m learning Kubernetes and Flux. Two of my top three favourite methods for learning something is to write about it and to teach it to someone else. This time I combined the two into a short tutorial on what I have learnt so far. If you are interested, you will find my Kubernetes tutorial on Github!</description></item><item><title>DNS Record Types</title><link>/DNS-Record-Types/</link><pubDate>Wed, 11 Nov 2020 14:28:20 +0000</pubDate><guid>/DNS-Record-Types/</guid><description>In this blog post I will briefly explain some of the most common DNS record types.
A (address) record: always points to a static IP address. AAAA record: the same as the A type record, but for IPv6 IP addresses. CNAME (canonical name) record: alias to another name (=domain), which can be an A record or another CNAME record. The only exception is that you cannot create a CNAME record in the zone apex (the root of your domain).</description></item></channel></rss>
