My name is Gustav Sundin and I currently work as software engineering consultant at Devies in Gothenburg, Sweden. I also hold a Master’s degree in Software Engineering from Chalmers University. A cool thing with that is that I am allowed to titulate myself “Master of Software Engineering”!

The main goal with this blog is for myself to cultivate my thoughts and ideas into a more concrete form. If someone else reads somehting here and finds it enlightening, that would come as a huge bonus to me!

Apart from being obsessed by software engineering (software architecture being the area I’m most interested in), I’m also a heavy metal maniac. You will find my metallic writing here.

Welcome to my awesome blog on software engineering. It includes some of my own philosophizing, as well various interesting subjects I have stumbled across online.
