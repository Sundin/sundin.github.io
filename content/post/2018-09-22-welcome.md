Welcome to my brand new blog on software engineering!

In my daily work as a software engineer, I read and think a lot on various topics and also write a lot of notes as I do so. My main goal with this website is to gather some of my notes in a single place and in a slightly more readable format. It also feels like a great opportunity to share some of my findings and thoughts with anyone that is interested.

Some of the writing present here will be my own thoughts and some will be the summarized ideas from other eminent writers, practitioners and thinkers. I will try to clearly mark whenever something is not my own creation and give proper sources where possible. If you spot any mistakes I've made, feel free to correct me by [issuing a pull request to my Github repo](https://github.com/Sundin/sundin.github.io).
