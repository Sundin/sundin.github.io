[![Sound Realms: Mace & Magic](/sound-realms.jpg)](https://www.sound-realms.com/)

[Sound Realms: Mace & Magic](https://www.sound-realms.com/) is an audio-based solo RPG adventure app for iOS and Android devices. I have been programming on it for around 8 hours per week since October 2020, so by now it is starting to shape up real good! [Download the free demo adventure](https://www.sound-realms.com/download) to your phone if you are intrigued. 

The idea is to craft an inspiring and captivating experience that lets you use your imagination. We want to make a stance against the ordinary so called mobile games that mostly seem to be a waste of good time, money, and brain cells. Our goal is instead to encourage you to activate your imagination and creativity and leave you with a sense of having time well spent in the [Forsaken Lands of Mihr](https://www.sound-realms.com/faq).

The app is built using Flutter, which has been a real pleasure to use so far. In my opinion, Flutter actually fulfills all the broken promises on "code once, run everywhere" of other cross-platform frameworks - a real game changer in fact! Expect more technical posts regarding this to come here on the blog in future. 

So [try out the game](https://www.sound-realms.com/download)  (the perfect opportunity is when you are on the bus or train) and let me know what you think. Headphones are recommended to enjoy the full 360 degree sound to the fullest.
