In the .NET Core 5.0 API we are building right now, we decided to implement this functionality as a middleware that will automatically be executed upon every request to the API.
We want to log the response actually sent back to the client, so it&amp;rsquo;s important that we put our new middleware first (or at least very early) in the HTTP request pipeline.</description></item></channel></rss>
