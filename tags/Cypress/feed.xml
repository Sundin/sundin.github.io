It is intended to be read as a high level overview of best practices, as there are already plenty of great and detailed tutorials on various frameworks &amp;ldquo;out there&amp;rdquo; on the Internet. This guide uses Cypress as the example testing framework (just because it&amp;rsquo;s the one I use the most), but the same methodology as described here can be applied using any framework.</description></item><item><title>Robust end-to-end testing with Docker Compose</title><link>/e2e-tests-with-docker-compose/</link><pubDate>Fri, 04 Feb 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/e2e-tests-with-docker-compose/</guid><description>End-to-end (E2E) testing is a powerful tool for automated quality assurance. Ideally you want to be able to catch potential errors and bugs already on the unit testing level, but doing so can sometimes be both time-consuming and difficult. Unit testing also relies heavily on mocking out dependencies by nature, so we cannot necessarily guarantee the same behaviour as in our live application. E2E tests are on the other hand often very straightforward to set up and write, and enables us to construct very realistic testing scenarios.</description></item></channel></rss>
