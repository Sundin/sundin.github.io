A (address) record: always points to a static IP address. AAAA record: the same as the A type record, but for IPv6 IP addresses. CNAME (canonical name) record: alias to another name (=domain), which can be an A record or another CNAME record. The only exception is that you cannot create a CNAME record in the zone apex (the root of your domain).</description></item></channel></rss>
