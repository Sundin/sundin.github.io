It happened after a routine bump of the WordPress version running the WooCommerce web shop of my record label. Everything seemed to be running fine, but then one customer reported that the checkout was broken (very bad for a web shop). I verified that I could reproduce the error on my own and started troubleshooting.</description></item></channel></rss>
