If we have packaged our web application using Docker, that means that we would need to build a different container image for each different environment where we will want to host our application. This is a waste of resources and also introduces a risk of us ending up with a different codebase in our production environment than what we tried out in our QA or test environment.</description></item></channel></rss>
